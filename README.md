## Gameplay/Experience requirements:
- The game uses both continuous and discrete inputs from the player: ***SATISFIED***
    - Discrete: Arrow Key Button presses
    - Continuous: Acceleration + Drag player movement and a platform type that requires player to be at max speed while on it
- The playerâ€™s goal can only be achieved indirectly (by allowing the physics engine to move key objects into position/contact): ***SATISFIED***
    - Player must traverse each level as a mouse via physics engine movement (with arrow keys) and collision to acquire the object and go to the win condition area
- 3+ physics-based gameplay scenes (possibly implemented with a single Phaser Scene subclass): ***SATISFIED***
    - Level 1
    - Level 2
    - Level 3
- Other scenes are used to separate and contextualize the gameplay scenes: ***SATISFIED***
    - Main Menu Screen (How to Play Controls + Level Select)
    - End of Level Summaries (Shows Level Completed, Attempts to win, Time to complete, and Next Level + Main Menu buttons)

## Asset sources:
All assets and sound effects created myself using Illustrator and audacity except the ones listed below:
- [Mouse](https://www.pngkit.com/bigpic/u2e6r5t4q8a9e6r5/): I changed the tail color.
- [Cheese](http://pixelartmaker.com/art/605a4c2a78ea075): I added a black outline around the cheese.
